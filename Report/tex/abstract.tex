    Path tracing is a rendering technique that lends itself to parallellization very well.
    In this paper, parallellizing this technique over virtual machines in a cloud is described.
    This is achieved by introducing a master node to handle the division of labor between worker nodes.
    Experiments show that the system provides automation, elasticity, performance, reliability, multitenancy and monitoring.
    We conclude with the fact that IaaS can be worthwile for complex performance-critical cloud applications.
