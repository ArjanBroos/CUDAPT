    Path tracing is a rendering technique that lends itself to parallellization very well.
    In this paper, parallellizing this technique over virtual machines in a cloud is described.
    This is achieved by introducing a master node to handle the division of labor between worker nodes.
    The system provides elasticity, load balancing, multitenancy and monitoring.
    Experiments show that...
    We conclude with...
