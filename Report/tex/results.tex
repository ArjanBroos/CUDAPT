In this section, we describe the results of the three experiments mentioned earlier.

\subsection{Multitenancy and elasticity experiment}

\subsection{Load balancing experiment}

\subsection{Reliability experiment}

\subsection{Cost analysis}
The largest movie (job) rendered on the das4 server was a movie of 300 frames (10 seconds) with 1000 samples (path trace iterations) with a resolution of ($800 \times 600$). Das4 was configured with one master node and 10 worker nodes. The total computation  time to render the movie was 10 hour. In total this is 11 machines $\times$ 10 hours $=$ 110 instance hours. Assuming that an AmazonEC2 instance is as fast as a das4 instance, and an AmazonEC2 instance is charged for \EUR$0,10$ per instance hour, rendering the 10 seconds movie would cost \EUR{$11,00$}, which is \EUR$1,10$ to render one second of a movie.\\
If rendering is not going to be a core business it is advised to make use of the Amazon Web Services. Affording dedicated hardware is not recommended, purchasing the required hardware is expensive and not worth it.\\
However, if rendering is core business, then it is advisable to purchase dedicated hardware. \EUR$1,10$ per second of a movie is quite expensive, especially if a lot of movies are going to be rendered. For core business rendering, purchasing dedicated hardware could definitly save a penny.
