In this section, we describe the experimental setup.

\subsection{DAS-4}
Our cloud path tracer system has been set up on the DAS-4\cite{das4}.
This is a distributed supercomputer which consists of six different clusters, provided by several Dutch universities and institutions.

Using OpenNebula, provided by DAS-4, 11 different virtual machines are created.
Ten of them for worker nodes, and another with an extra 8GB of harddisk space for the master node.

Workers will always be running their program, but essentially be idle when not assigned any work.
This is because of the blocking socket receive call, which causes the program to halt until it receives a task from the master node.
This does mean, however, that the starting and stopping of virtual machines is not taken into account for any of our experiments.
