In this section, we describe details about the implemenation of the system.

\subsection{Separation}
We have implemented the master and worker nodes in separate programs.
The functionality of the worker node includes a stripped down version our CUDAPT\cite{cudapt} path tracer.
Here, all parallellization per pixel using the graphics card was removed and simply runs sequentially.

\subsection{Communication}
Communication between the master node and worker nodes happens via sockets.
The master node acts as a server, listening for incoming connections and spawns a new thread to handle each accepted connection.

Once the master node is listening, worker nodes can make a connection with it.

Once connected, the master node can start sending tasks to workers.
These will perform their tasks by rendering the frame that corresponds to the given task and then send the raw image data back to the master node.
The master node collects all of this image data and stores it on disk.
